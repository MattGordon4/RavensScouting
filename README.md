# README

Application I developed in Ruby on Rails that could serve as an internal space for NFL scouts (Ravens themed because I am from Baltimore) to post scouting reports for themselves and their colleagues to see. A scout will make an account and be able to create scouting reports as well as view scouting reports made by other scouts.
